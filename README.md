# DP-SynGen

This repository contains code for the DP-SynGen, which allows you to leverage the programmatically generated synthetic data for differential private training. 

You can access the paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09842


# Introduction
We base our training on the code available at https://github.com/nv-tlabs/DPDM. For generating the synthetic data, we utilize the code at https://github.com/mbaradad/learning_with_noise.
